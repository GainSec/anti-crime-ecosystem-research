## Overview
This repository hosts the public release of independent research into an anti-crime technology ecosystem, including a gunshot detection system, license plate readers, and compute modules.

It documents **51 findings**, 22 with assigned CVEs and an additional 8 pending assignment related but not limited to authentication, cryptography, and system design in an anti-crime technology ecosystem.

## Research Context
The majority of findings and supporting material were previously disclosed through informal full disclosure write-ups published on GainSec.com. Those earlier posts were technical and informal to facilitate timely awareness and community discussion, copies of the write-ups and technical summaries were also provided to the vendor during the responsible disclosure process.

While earlier publications included literal command strings and example values (full disclosure), this whitepaper and its accompanying materials have undergone purposeful redactions, both for findings that have completed their full disclosure windows and for those still pending, not yet submitted, or not planned for formal CVE assignment. These redactions ensure the research remains transparent, verifiable, and educational while minimizing any potential for misuse.

This repository serves as the authoritative, continuously maintained archive for the research. It consolidates previously released material into a formal, versioned whitepaper and will be updated as pending disclosures reach their full disclosure windows and as any follow on research is conducted.

## Responsible Disclosure
All devices were lawfully procured and tested in isolated lab environments. Findings were reported to the vendor following a responsible disclosure timeline. No production systems or networks were accessed or affected. Further details about the responsible disclosure process are available within the whitepaper.

**CVE coordination:** MITRE / NIST NVD  
**Disclosure window:** Feb 2025 → Feb 2026 (as of latest publication)  
**Vendor notified:** Flock Safety "The Vendor" (details provided in the whitepaper)
